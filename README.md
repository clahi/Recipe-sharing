# Recipe-Sharing
A recipe sharing Application

# Project overview
In this project, we will work on an application for sharing recipes, where a user can create, delete, or
read their recipes. We will implement both a backend and a frontend to develop a fully
functional web application.

## Functional Requirements
Our application should serve two different profiles: admins and end users.
 - Platform admin: The platform owner, who may want to create a new recipe, maintain it, or even delete it.
 - End users/consumers: The end user, who uses the platform for accessing a specific recipe, and should not be able to create, change, or delete any record.

 We will start with two different pages, **/users** for the end users and **/admin** for admins, to support the two differnt personas.
